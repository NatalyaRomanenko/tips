    <h1>Lesson #2</h1>
In this lesson we learmed about first steps to create the website.
Keywords - boilerplate, meta, charset (coding)
So boilerplate is like a blank code, which is used in every page.
Each document has to have a head and a body. In head there title and meta data. Basicaly head is  information about the page. And the bpdy section is the page itself.
Charset is atribut of meta tag which indicated how to decode the charecters. And in the blank pasted be emmet plugin there is UNICODE. Which is universal code. Angela recommend to read a small book about it.
