    <h1>Lesson #3</h1>
We've started to build up our personal site from the last century.
I really like to work in atom. It has autosuggest, it closes the tag automatically. <br>
I need to read more on difference between I and Em tag and B and STRONG tags.
<br>
And I hust love beautify package for atom. Neat and clean code autmatically. Great!
<br>Go back to <a href="index.html">homepage</a> now.
