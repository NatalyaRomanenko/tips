  <h1>Lesson #1</h1>
  <h2>In first lesson of "Introduction to HTML" block I've learned
    few tags: h1-6 br hr. And this one is actually h2 </h2>
  <h3>And this is h3. By the way, this tag must have opening and ending.
    While there are tags which need only opening.</h3>
  <h4>Like tag br, which I used after the headline "Notes"</h4>
  <hr size="5" noshade color="purple">
  <h5>And like the tag wich I used to create this line</h5>
  <h6>Another inportant thing I've learned - is that there are
    online documentation on all tags. HTML, CSS and so on. Devocs.io,
    w3schools.com and developer.mosilla.org. At these websites you can
     find all information about all tags. Which I think is great.</h6>
