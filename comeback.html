    <h1>Hello again!</h1>
<p>Well, I have been out for... couple of months. Jeez. Now I'm back to learning coding.</p>
<ol>Things I've forgotten
  <li>Tags for lists</li>
  <li>Tags for tables</li>
</ol>
<p>But on the first lesson after a break I've done a practical assignment.
   I've done everything correctly</p>
<p>
  Also,I'd like to mention that I've had troubles with form. We used
  "mailto" attribution, and I couldn't check if I've done everything
  right cause of promlems on my PC. <br>
I need to learn more about forms...
