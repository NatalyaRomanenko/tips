    <h3>Tables and forms</h3>
<p>Today we learned how to create and use tables. So, they can be used not only as regular tables in word. But they also can be used to arrange different blocks on the site. And that's what I did. I had some small difficulty with doing table with 4 columns, but then I fugured what was the prodlem.</p>
<p>I also learned a litle bit about forms. Now I really need to go trough documentation. </p>
